# Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am Agnieszka and I am a Junior Java Developer 👩🏻‍💻.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of programming in Java and learning the React framework.

I created the Library as the first application 📕📗📘📙 

Its task is to store information about the books and their borrowings in the database.

This application has <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/java.png" width="30px"> backend and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/angular.png" width="30px"> frontend.

 
 
I am currently working on the animal helper application.
