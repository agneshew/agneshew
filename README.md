# Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am Agnieszka and I am a Junior Java Developer 👩🏻‍💻.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of programming in Java and learning the React framework.

My last app is Booking App - it can be use to book working place - current office and current desk. 
In pandemic and hybrid work time it is the best app 🙂💼💻


My previous ones app was made in Java. 
The bigger one:
1. Library - its task is to store information about the books and their borrowings in the database.
📕📗📘📙 
2. Tasks - its task is to store and add tasks to Trello
