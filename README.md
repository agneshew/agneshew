# Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am Agnieszka and I am a beginner Java developer (or wanna be a developer 👩🏻‍💻).

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of programming in Java and learning the Angular framework.

As the first I created an application library 📕📗📘📙

This application has <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/java.png" width="30px"> backend and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/angular.png" width="30px"> frontend.


At present, already have experience in writing applications in the backend and frontend part I want to Dean's Office application could create - at the beginning will be used to generate and print timetables students. 

Subsequently, other functionalities will be added, such as exam dates, grades sheet and others.


At the same time, in my free time I practice your skills in Java with CodingBat. You can find solutions in my CodingBatJava repository.
