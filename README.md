# Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am Agnieszka and I am a beginner Java developer 👩🏻‍💻.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge of programming in Java and learning the Angular framework.

I created the Library as the first application 📕📗📘📙 

Its task is to store information about the books and their borrowings in the database.

This application has <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/java.png" width="30px"> backend and <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agneshew/agneshew/main/angular.png" width="30px"> frontend.


Another project I made was the ScrapeIt application - it is used to store files 📁 in the database 💾


Currently, I want to create an application - Question Generator for Qualification Interviews ❓❔🗳


At the same time, in my free time I practice your skills in Java. You can find task solutions in my CodingBatJava and Codility repository.
